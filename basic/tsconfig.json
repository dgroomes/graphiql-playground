/*
The 'tsconfig.json' file is actually interpreted as a 'jsonc' ("JSON with comments") file so we are allowed to write
comments! This is great because we can explain why we're using otherwise esoteric configurations. At least, comments are
useful to people who haven't mastered TypeScript (which is the vast majority of developers, including myself).

See the official reference documentation for tsconfig: https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig
