## Overview

GraphiQL is a rich and actively-developed toolkit for creating GraphQL tooling using web technologies: HTML, CSS and
JavaScript. I want to learn more about it, and this repository is a place for me to do that.


## Standalone sub-projects

This repository illustrates different concepts, patterns and examples via standalone sub-projects. Each sub-project is
completely independent of the others and do not depend on the root project. This _standalone sub-project constraint_
forces the sub-projects to be complete and maximizes the reader's chances of successfully running, understanding, and
re-using the code.

The sub-projects include:


### `basic/`

A basic GraphiQL project that fronts the `graphql-pokemon` project's GraphQL API.

See the README in [basic/](basic/).


### `custom-ui/`

A custom interface built from individual components of the GraphiQL library.

See the README in [custom-ui/](custom-ui/).


## Wish List

General clean-ups, TODOs and things I wish to implement for this project:

* [x] DONE Create a `basic` example project that is a minimal GraphiQL setup. It uses JS (update: well whatever, I'm going to use TypeScript). It doesn't customize anything.
  Maybe query the GitHub GraphQL API? Use esbuild.
* [ ] IN PROGRESS Create a deconstructed example which exposes some pre-built queries and shows the results in a bespoke summary
  view (instead of JSON). This works if the queries are fixed (exact known shape of the data) and so the summary view
  can also be fixed. Maybe use the GitHub GraphQL API as an example and show a summary of my repos.
